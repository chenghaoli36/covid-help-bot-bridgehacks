# covid-help-bot
### an opensource discord chatbot, moderation, music, and informational bot to help people during the covid pandemic

## Why would you want to use this?

During the pandemic, many people find that they are spending more time alone. Survey conducted by Harris Poll on behalf of the National 4-H Council shows that 7 out of 10 teenagers said that they were struggling with their mental health in some way and 61% of teenagers said that the pandemic has increased their feelings of loneliness. Since everyone is at home, people will inevitably spend more time online. Using discord, a platform with over 250 million users, we can make a bot that helps people deal with the whole pandemic. This bot can maintain conversations, tell jokes and give important information on covid so people can stay informed. This bot isn't only just a chatbot and informational bot, it can browse reddit, play music, and moderate servers to keep you and whoevers on your server entertained.
